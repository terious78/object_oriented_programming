# Object-Oriented Programming

# It is way of solving problems
# Bring and organise the objects.
# Object has 3 parts : Name,
#                      Information (object has state),
#                      Object Behavior
# Behavior(action) modifie state

# Advantage of objects
# Can create something that can be understood and reasoned about
# Don't care how it works, just what it can do

# Data Encapsulation
# State has to be private by default
# Behavior - Public

# Class - Catagory
# 'Instences' - Happens in once
# Instruction to create instences
# Same behavior
